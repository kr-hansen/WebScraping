# WebScraping
Code for Web Scraping in Python

Similar to my DownloadWebPDFs, but intended to be a more general repo for more versions of code than just the one for downloading PDFs.

Requires:
Selenium - http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html 

Beautiful Soup - https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

Uses:
Pandas (Though Not Required.  Could reformat History list to another format and save output another way if preferred) - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
